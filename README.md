# Vanguard A/B Test – Process Completion Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes an **A/B test conducted by Vanguard** to evaluate the impact of a redesigned client interface.  
The goal was to measure whether the new design improved **process completion, speed, and stability** compared to the traditional interface.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **data_cleaned/** → Preprocessed datasets ready for analysis.  
- **vanguard_notebooks/** → Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis (EDA), KPI computation, and hypothesis testing.  
- **vanguard_presentation/** → Final slides used to present results and conclusions.  
- **vanguard_visuals/** → Exported visuals (charts, dashboards) created with Tableau and Python.  
- **README.md** → Project documentation.  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- 🐍 **Python** → Data cleaning, KPI analysis, hypothesis testing (`pandas`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`).  
- 📊 **Tableau** → Interactive dashboards and KPI visuals.  
- 🎨 **Canva** → Design and final presentation graphics.  
- 💻 **GitHub** → Version control and project collaboration.  

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- ✅ **Completion rate** improved under the test design.  
- ⚡ **Speed index** showed faster transitions in the new interface.  
- ⚠️ **Stability** decreased slightly with more backtracks and errors.  
- 👥 Client behavior varied significantly by **age** and **tenure**, with younger and newer clients converting more often.  

## 📊 Results  
- The redesigned interface showed **higher completion and faster process speed**,  
  but at the cost of slightly higher error and backtrack rates.  
- Overall, the new design demonstrated potential improvements in **efficiency**  
  but highlighted areas needing further refinement.
